# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c)
Print `_putchar` followed by a new line.

## [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c)
Print the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line:
* by creating the `void print_alphabet(void)` function
* using `_putchar` twice

## [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)
Print the alphabet in lowercase 10 times followed by a new line:
* by creating the `void print_alphabet_x10(void)` function
* using `_putchar` twice

## [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c)
Check for lowercase character by creating the `int _islower(int c)` function.

## [4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c)
Check for alphabetic character by creating the `int _isalpha(int c)` function.

## [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c)
Print the sign of a number by creating the `int print_sign(int n)` function.

## [6-abs.c](./6-abs.c)
Compute the absolute value of an integer by creating the `int _abs(int)`
function.

## [7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c)
Print the last digit of a number by creating the `int print_last_digit(int)`
function.

## [8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c)
Print every minute of the day of Jack Bauer from 00:00 to 23:59 by creating
the `void jack_bauer(void)` function.

## [9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c)
Print the 9 times table, starting with 0 by creating the
`void times_table(void)` function.

## [10-add.c](./10-add.c)
Add two integers and return the result by creating the `int add(int, int)`
function.

## [11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c)
Print all natural numbers from `n` to `98` followed by a new line:
* by creating the `void print_to_98(int n)` function
* separated by `,` and a space
* should be printed in order
* first printed is `n` and last printed is `98`

## [100-times_table.c](./100-times_table.c)
Print the `n` times table, starting with 0:
* by creating the `void print_times_table(int n)` function
* if `n` is greater than `15` or less than `0` the function doesn't print
anything

## [101-natural.c](./101-natural.c)
Compute and print the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024`
(exluded) followed by a new line.

## [102-fibonacci.c](./102-fibonacci.c)
Print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers starting with `1` and `2` followed by
a new line and separated by `,` and a space

## [103-fibonacci.c](./103-fibonacci.c)
Find and print the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence whose
values don't exceed 4,000,000 followed by a new line.

## [104-fibonacci.c](./104-fibonacci.c)
Find and print the first 98 Fibonacci numbers `1` and `2` followed by a new line:
* separated by `,` and a space
* without using the standard library or any other
* without using `long long`, `malloc`, pointers, arrays/tables or structures
* without hard coding any Fibonacci number except `1` and `2`
